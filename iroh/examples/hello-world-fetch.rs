//! An example that fetches an iroh blob and prints the contents.
//! Will only work with blobs and collections that contain text, and is meant as a companion to the `hello-world-get` examples.
//!
//! This is using an in memory database and a random node id.
//! Run the `provide` example, which will give you instructions on how to run this example.
