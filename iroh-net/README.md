# iroh-net

This crate contains the networking support for iroh. Iroh networking is built on direct peer-to-peer [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) connections that use relays and holepunching. The main structure for connection is the `MagicEndpoint` entrypoint.

Peer to peer connectivity is established with the help of a _relay server_. The relay server provides Session Traversal Utilities for NAT [(STUN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) for the peers and connection coordination using the [DERP protocol](https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com/derp) (Designated Relay for Encrypted Packets protocol). If no direct connection can be established, the connection is relayed via the server.

Peers must know and do verify the PeerID of each other before they can connect. When using a relay server to aid the connection establishment they will register with a home relay server using their PublicKey.  Other peers which can not establish a direct connection can then establish connection via this relay server.  This will try to assist establishing a direct connection using STUN and holepunching but continue relaying if not possible.

Peers can also connect directly without using a relay server. For this, however the listening peer must be directly reachable by the connecting peer via one of it's addresses.
